<p>My comic application for Windows Phone 7, called ComicDB, has been published for a good month now and as I’m working on version 2 I got an idea to build a Windows desktop application. The application will allow users to maintain a library of comic series and to keep track of owned and read issues, something I’m struggling with myself. I decided to make a blogseries about my progress, I started working on it today so I’ll try to get the first post online in a few days.</p>  <p>Some details:</p>  <ul>   <li>WPF application</li>    <li>Metro style</li>    <li>MVVM Light</li>    <li>trying to use the SOLID principles</li> </ul>  <p>I’m currently learning SOLID principles and design patterns, so some refactoring might occur but I think it’ll be fun for you to follow my learning progress and it’ll be fun for me to build now and to look back to in a few years</p>
