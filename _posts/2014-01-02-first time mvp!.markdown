<p>The year 2014 started of with a bang for me. On January 1st I was very honored to receive this mail</p>  <p><a href="http://i39.tinypic.com/14uja7s.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/14uja7s.jpg" width="624" height="119" /></a></p>  <p>Meaning I just became a Microsoft MVP in the field of Client Development. I’m joining some big names in that group, names like Gill Cleeren, Laurent Bugnion, Fons Sonnemans, Jesse Liberty and many more (for a complete list, see <a href="http://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/search-mvp.aspx?ty=a&amp;ex=Client+Development&amp;sc=n&amp;pn=1" target="_blank">the MVP site</a>)</p>  <p>The most mind blowing thing for me is that in a few months I’ll be able to go to the MVP summit and talk to these big guys that I’ve been looking up to for years.</p>  <p>Thank you Microsoft for the trust and the honor! </p>  <p><img src="http://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0Fu7UbGwOSM/Toy0YG3UW-I/AAAAAAAAG2A/sgPCYBRtewk/s144/mvp.png" /></p>
