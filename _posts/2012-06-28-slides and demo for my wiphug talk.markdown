<p>Yesterday I did a talk in the Belgian Windows Phone User Group about beginning XNA development. It was the first time I did a talk in my own user group and I had a great time.</p>
<p>I also learned a very valuable lesson: don't name your Autohotkey snippets the same as your classes. It was quite the hilarious moment when I entered the class name in the "Add File" dialog and hit the Enter key.</p>
<p>Besides that small setback everything went great. The slidedeck and demo (shooting iphones down with a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">pink</span> magenta Lumia) are zipped up and can be found <a href="http://sdrv.ms/LD7P8Q" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
