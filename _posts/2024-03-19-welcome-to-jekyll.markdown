It's been ages since I was blogging, I've been more focusses on visiting conferences as a speaker and organizing different community events.
Since it was getting hard to keep track of everything I'm doing, I decided to relaunch my blog with Jekyll. This way I can keep track of all my speaking engagements and share my experiences with the community.

My old blog used to run on Jekyll as well, with a portable Jekyll / Ruby setup, but that project seems to have been abandoned by the authors. However, times have changed and this time around I'm developing my blog and writing my posts using DevContainers in Visual Studio Code. This way I just need to configure what base image to use, Docker will spin up a container configured with everything I need to write and test my blog posts. Visual Studio Code connects to the container and I can start writing my posts.

I'm excited to share my experiences with you, both technical and as a speaker / organizer, and I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts as much as I enjoy writing them.
