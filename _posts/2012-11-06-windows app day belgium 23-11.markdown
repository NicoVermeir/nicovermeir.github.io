<p>That Microsoft loves his communities is no secret. The past months we literally drowned in hackathons, trainings, competitions and many more Windows 8 related. And it doesn’t look like it’s stopping any time soon! On November 23th Microsoft Belgium organizes the Windows App Day, a day stuffed to the top with sessions divided into two tracks, one for developers and one for designers. And the best part? It’s not only for Windows 8! Windows Azure and my all time favorite platform, Windows Phone 8 will be represented as well.</p>  <p>So if you’re in or around Belgium on November 23th and feel like spending the day with our great community feel free to drop by. There might even be some very cool announcement concerning people that are into Windows 8 development… drop by to get the full story (and start thinking about that one killer app)!</p>  <p>Details:</p>  <p><b>When</b>: Friday 23 November 2012, 9AM to 6PM </p>  <p><b>Where</b>: ALM Meeting Point </p>  <p>Filip Williotstraat 9 </p>  <p>2600 Antwerp (Berchem)</p>  <p>All details: <u><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/windows-app-day/default.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/belux/msdn/windows-app-day/default.aspx</a></u></p>  <p><a href="http://www.spikie.be/blog/images/header_app-day.jpg"><img title="header_app-day" style="border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; float: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-left: auto; border-left: 0px; display: block; padding-right: 0px; margin-right: auto" border="0" alt="header_app-day" src="http://www.spikie.be/blog/images/header_app-day_thumb.jpg" width="600" height="131" /></a></p>
