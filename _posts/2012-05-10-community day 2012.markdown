<p>Here in Belgium we .net developers have an awesome community. An entire washlist of User groups (including the Windows Phone User Group that I'm a founding member off) that organise free events on a regular base.</p>
<p>Once a year all user groups get together for a full day, completely free event called Community Day. This year Community Day will take place on June 21st and will have 6 tracks full of IT-pro and developer sessions.</p>
<p>For me it will be the third time that I'll attend this great event but it will be my first time actually doing a session there, I'll be presenting about converting a Windows Phone 7 application to Windows 8 Metro. I'm really looking forward to this as I never talked in front of such a big audience, let alone did a talk in a movie theatre.</p>
<p>If you're attending as well, feel free to come talk to me about anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
