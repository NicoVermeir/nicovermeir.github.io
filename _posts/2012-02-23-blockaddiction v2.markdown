<p>Version 2.0 of BlockAddiction has passed marketplace certification and is available for download now. The biggest change is the all new Time Attack mode where you have to survive for 60 seconds and score as high as possible. Game Over means no score.</p>  <p>BlockAddiction has reached well over 400 downloads and is available on Windows Phone marketplace (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/nl-BE/apps/7c1427fc-c472-4a8a-abf8-433c823e1636" target="_blank">Link</a>).</p>  <p>I was thinking about an About page and advertising but I figured ads could ruin the experience and I completely forgot about the About page. <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Glimlach" src="http://www.spikie.be/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_6.png" /> I might add it in the future but for now my focus shifted to some other projects.</p>  <p>If youâ€™ve got ideas, bug reports or some other feedback, leave a comment, contact me via Twitter or send me a mail!</p>
