<p>Yesterday was Community Day, the biggest community driven event in Belgium.</p>
<p>I did a talk there about porting over a Windows Phone 7 app to Windows 8. It was very exciting, I never spoke to such a crowd before, let alone hooked up my portable to a cinema beamer.</p>
<p>The talk itself went pretty well but I did suffer from demo failure, what was really odd since the demo worked perfectly an hour earlier. I researched the error after the talk and it seems that in a Windows 8 Metro app the path to the manifest file is an absolute path for some reason. I suddenly remembered that I moved the solution to another folder right before the talk, so it was my own fault. Reminder to self: never move a folder before doing a talk.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was a great day, I've met some nice people, had fun discussions and attended an App clinic on UI (thanks Lesley for the useful information!). See you next year community day!</p>
