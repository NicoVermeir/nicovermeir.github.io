<p>I had the pleasure of presenting an MSDN webcast on SignalR and Windows Phone 8 yesterday. I had a great time presenting and believe it or not, all demos actually worked! (it was live coding)</p>  <p>The stream was recorded and will be available on Channel 9 soon, in the meantime you can download the demos <a href="http://sdrv.ms/YSWol6" target="_blank">here</a> (the chat application in the download also has a Windows 8 client as an added bonus).</p>  <p>This slides are on SlideShare.</p> <br /> <iframe height="400" marginheight="0" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/18973642" frameborder="0" width="476" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><script type="text/javascript"><!--
