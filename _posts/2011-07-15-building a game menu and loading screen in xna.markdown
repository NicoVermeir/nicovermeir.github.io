<p>I’ve spent a lot of time searching for a way to get menus and loading screens working in XNA. XNA has no controls like textboxes and buttons like we’re accustomed to in winforms, ASP and so on.</p>  <p>So after searching and only finding half working solutions I decided to share the way I do it with the community.   <br />The result is a five page guide and a link to my solution</p>  <p><a href="http://www.spikie.be/blog/page/Building-a-main-menu-and-loading-screens-in-XNA.aspx" target="_blank">Click here to get started!</a></p>
