<p>Today I did my second MSDN webcast, this time about the brand new Windows Phone 8 SDK. I had great fun doing this, I knew what to expect so I went in relaxed and just enjoyed it. This time even the audio and recording went fine (had no sound for the first five minute last time). The recording is being edited the coming days and should be on Channel9 somewhere next week I think, I’ll update this post when it’s online.</p>  <p>Until then, my demos can be found on <a href="http://sdrv.ms/S4ituh" target="_blank">SkyDrive</a> and my slides are on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/nicovermeir/discovering-the-wp8-sdk?ref=http://www.spikie.be/blog/" target="_blank">SlideShare</a>.</p>  <p><iframe height="400" marginheight="0" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15590378" frameborder="0" width="476" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
