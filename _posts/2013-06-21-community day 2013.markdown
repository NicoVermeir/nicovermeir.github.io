<p><img src="http://www.communityday.be/data/2013/long.png" /></p>  <p>Yesterday was the day for Community day 2013, already the seventh edition. A bunch of user groups working together to create a great agenda of presentations by community, for community.</p>  <p>This seventh edition was in my opinion the best one so far, the quality of the talks I followed was incredible and I’ve learned quite a lot.</p>  <p>I also did my own talk on SignalR and Windows Phone 8. Here you can find my slidedeck.</p>  <p><iframe height="400" marginheight="0" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/23270467" frameborder="0" width="476" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>And my demos can be found here (this includes the chat demo, the leap motion demo and the Photobeamer clone.</p>  <p><iframe height="120" src="https://skydrive.live.com/embed?cid=5A345BB15E973473&amp;resid=5A345BB15E973473%2129840&amp;authkey=AJNly6ke_rJoG9E" frameborder="0" width="98" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>  <p>As mentioned during my talk, the photobeamer clone is something I did a blogpost on a while back, for those interested the post can be found <a href="http://www.spikie.be/blog/post/2013/01/21/Copying-Nokia&rsquo;s-Photobeamer-with-SignalR-and-WP8.aspx" target="_blank">here</a></p>  <p>I had a blast at Community day 2013 and I’m already looking forward to the next edition!</p>
