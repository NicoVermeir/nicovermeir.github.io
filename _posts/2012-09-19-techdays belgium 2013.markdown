<p>Word just got out this morning that Techdays Belgium will happen on 5, 6 and 7 March.</p>
<p>Just as the previous years I'll be there! Although this year will be kind off special as it is my first Techdays as a MEET member. MEET will get some attention at Techdays as usual, the how and what will be discussed in the coming months.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this edition of Techdays will probably be all about the new and reimagined Microsoft. I excpect loads of sessions on Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, Azure and everything combined. I'm already looking forward to it and if you plan on attending, be sure to find me somewhere and come say hi.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
