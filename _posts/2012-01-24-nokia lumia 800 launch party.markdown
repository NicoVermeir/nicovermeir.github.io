<p>Last friday Nokia Belgium officially showed the Lumia 800 to the crowd in Belgium. 1300 people signed up for the event, 100 received an invitation. I was one of the lucky few that was there.</p>  <p>The party started at 6PM in the Event Lounge in Brussels. The lounge was nicely decorated with balloons, banners and promo girls from Nokia. Microsoft had some xbox360 systems available with Kinect for some fun and entertainment (Fruit Ninja Kinect is a blast!). Immediately at the entrance there was a possibility to try the Lumia 800 in all its different colors. After about an hour of fun and networking it was time to start the presentations.</p>  <p align="center"><img src="https://pwn7gq.blu.livefilestore.com/y1moin3v7r_v3BIQmv0CrWAIKdeL41vmKV0u2jVDNcDzr6foF9SJRpTJcul8pLqoiSdCkbFk-lspRrqKHUw08BNMsKwI_4qpZSFagb4MvlTMZ0/WP_000141.jpg?psid=1" width="180" height="240" /></p>  <p>The first speaker was Jurgen Thysmans, Communications Manager at Nokia Belgium. He told the audience that the Lumia 800 will be available on the 1st of February for about 499 euros. The Lumia 710 will be available on the 1st of March exclusively at Proximus, a Belgian provider. No price was given for the 710.</p>  <p>After Jurgen a reviewer from ZDnet took over, he wrote a review on the Lumia 800 and had some negative points about the device. Afterwards it became clear that he wrote a review based on a prototype with pre-release hard and software. Where I come from we call that a Preview but hey, what’s in a word… His mock-up of the Microkia logo was pretty funny but that’s about all I remember about his talk.</p>  <p align="center"><img src="https://pwn7gq.blu.livefilestore.com/y1mAg9AHWusf4HaxO0yK4R50k-030BMJVOTyVxf8_JmklBI1MiVIpwVGHc336JOg46PvkVFIxVTr3wwNQA5OPC2ErLQ2NntUjb_Jfhp4S5dn6E/WP_000145.jpg?psid=1" width="240" height="180" /></p>  <p>Closing the presentation was Jeroen Van Hees, he’s a Portfolio Manager at Microsoft Belgium. He gave us a live demo on his personal Lumia 800 device, whooing a lot of the guests with the snappyness of WP7 and the awesome design of the Lumia. The reactions were amazing, both in the room and on Twitter (hashtag #lumiabxl).</p>  <p>After the presentation, a young lady from Nokia did some challenges like Ben the pc guy did on CES. She challenged the attendees to put their non-WP7 smartphone against the Lumia, if they could beat her they’d receive a Nokia Play 360 wireless speaker. She smoked them all. Off course, the challenges were made to compliment the features of WP7, like taking pictures from the lockscreen, posting messages on Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn at the same time.</p>  <p>After the presentations it was time for food and drinks, did some more networking, met some really cool guys. It was a very fun and entertaining evening, and I got a Nokia Play 360 because I smoked the girl with the Lumia using my own Lumia 800 <img style="border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none" class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" alt="Glimlach" src="http://www.spikie.be/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_1.png" /></p>  <p align="center"><img src="https://pwn7gq.blu.livefilestore.com/y1msY2J8c21DRMYtHHm-yGJ-Eg3oXoSfUuJ_aXBNah_mIOFaCvjq-OShKnxeESoXLP34WzSI8AjVxIKoifsmelfFmjpax8pOvHgi3RcmrZduz4/WP_000149.jpg?psid=1" width="240" height="180" /></p>  <p>Thank you Microsoft and Nokia for an awesome event and see you hopefully at the Lumia 900 launch event!</p>  <p>For all the pictures, check out my <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=5a345bb15e973473&amp;resid=5A345BB15E973473!500&amp;parid=5A345BB15E973473!170&amp;authkey=!ADKYaBfJVczZ8uY" target="_blank">SkyDrive</a>.    <br />All pictures are taken with my Lumia 800.</p>
