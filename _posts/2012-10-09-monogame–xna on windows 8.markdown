<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>The good people of MonoGame brought it to my attention that MonoGame currently does not support Windows Phone 7 (XNA is supported on Windows Phone though) but they will probably support Windows Phone 8. Thanks for the heads up guys!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s currently no official support for XNA on Windows 8. That&rsquo;s actually a real shame because XNA is my favorite way to develop games and Windows 8 is a fun platform to develop on. Luckily there&rsquo;s always the community to come to our rescue. Enter MonoGame, an open source implementation of XNA for virtually any platform out there. Think iOS, Android,&nbsp; Windows 8, even Playstation Vita.</p>
<p>A while ago Wesley and me started working on a BreakOut clone for Windows 8 using MonoGame. We currently have a raw basic gameplay and a first level. We even released a first official screenshot <img class="wlEmoticon wlEmoticon-smile" style="border-style: none;" src="http://www.spikie.be/blog/images/wlEmoticon-smile_10.png" alt="Smile" /></p>

<p>I now the screenshot doesn&rsquo;t look really fancy yet (wel except for the giant pacman which is always awesome right?) but it&rsquo;s an early build of a work very much in progress.</p>
