<p>So keeping a blog does sound simple, but as it turns out it's not so easy to make time to update it :)<br />I'm going to try and update this more often as I continue my current projects</p>
<p>Some of my current projects:</p>
<p>- Migrating the Huize De Graef website from asp.net webforms application to MVC3 and build new admin panel<br />- Building an XNA game for Windows Phone 7<br />- Building a custom blog in MVC3</p>
<p>That's right, I'm working on my own blog software because both Wordpress and .net blogengine don't suffice for the full 100%<br />The plan is to also build a Windows Phone and Windows application to write blogposts.</p>
<p>All these projects are done in my spare time, which I don't really have a lot of, so updates will be slow. Also because I'm learning new stuff as I go.<br />So expect updates more often and hopefully finally some usefull articles as well.</p>
