<p>The Belgian MSDN team started an initiative a few weeks ago. They give the password to the MSDNBeLux Twitter account to someone from the community, that person gets to tweet about his favorite Microsoft technology for an entire week.</p>  <p>This week itâ€™s my turn, so if you follow the MSDN Belux Twitter account, expect to see some Windows Phone related tweets popping up!</p>
